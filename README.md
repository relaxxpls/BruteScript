# BruteScript V3 (PowerShell Debug Script)
### Do you love competitive coding but hate debugging ugly edge cases? BruteScript V3 is here to help!  
#### Prerequisites :
- Windows with PowerShell and G++ compiler 

#### How to get started!
- Copy your WA / failing code to the [wrong.cpp](PowerShell%20C%2B%2B%20Script/wrong.cpp) file (after deleting its contents)
- Copy an AC code or a BruteForce solution to the [correct.cpp](PowerShell%20C%2B%2B%20Script/correct.cpp) file (make sure to delete its contents too)
- Now all you need is a file to generate a whole bunch of random test cases, [inputgen.cpp](PowerShell%20C%2B%2B%20Script/inputgen.cpp) is here to help!
- Edit inputgen. cpp out according to your needs (i'll explain the format and its working below)
- Finally run the BruteScript V3.ps1 file by rightclicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell" (if your using Windows)

Note :
- Currently this project only supports C++, i'll be adding support for Python and Java soon
